# CLOSHA.0

Recent advances in various computational algorithms for high-throughput sequencing technologies have accelerated the progress toward a comprehensive understanding of genetic information. However, most of these tools are not user-friendly and interoperable, making it difficult for biologists to design pipelines to meet their needs. We present CLOSHA2.0, a bioinformatics analysis workflow management standard software. Using pipelines provided by CLOSHA2.0, even scientists with a little computer programming experience can easily analyze NGS data. CLOSHA2.0 can also support a computational environment to share analysis workflows and results with other research scientists.

CLOSHA is a an open source software developed by the Korean Bioinformation Center (KOBIC) that provides an easy-to-use workflow for next-generation sequence (NGS) data. CLOSHA2.0 has several pipelines to analyze each NGS data. Using these pipelines provided by CLOSHA2.0, even scientists with a little computer programming experience can 
easily analyze NGS data.

Composition of HPC-Cloud-Based CLOSHA2.0 System. Previous constructed system has difficult in analyzing massive dielectric date, CLOSHA2.0 system constructed system that enables you to the massive dielectric date analysis. Even though it is complicated and various conditions, it has tried to demonstrate optimum performance through user install CLOSHA2.0ã€€program and organic connection of workbench, it obtains contents of analysis service workflow and tries to offer various analysis workflow to numerous researchers.
