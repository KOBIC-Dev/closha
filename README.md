# CLOSHA.0

Recent advances in various computational algorithms for high-throughput sequencing technologies have accelerated the progress toward a comprehensive understanding of genetic information. However, most of these tools are not user-friendly and interoperable, making it difficult for biologists to design pipelines to meet their needs. We present CLOSHA2.0, a bioinformatics analysis workflow management standard software. Using pipelines provided by CLOSHA2.0, even scientists with a little computer programming experience can easily analyze NGS data. CLOSHA2.0 can also support a computational environment to share analysis workflows and results with other research scientists.

CLOSHA is a an open source software developed by the Korean Bioinformation Center (KOBIC) that provides an easy-to-use workflow for next-generation sequence (NGS) data. CLOSHA2.0 has several pipelines to analyze each NGS data. Using these pipelines provided by CLOSHA2.0, even scientists with a little computer programming experience can 
easily analyze NGS data.

Closha 2.0 supports container-based analysis execution, allowing analytical tools to run independently within containers. This prevents dependency issues and conflicts between different tools. As a result, multiple versions of the same tool can be executed in the same environment, maintaining the independence of analytical tool execution. Additionally, containers provide a consistent execution environment, ensuring the reproducibility of analysis tasks. The container-based architecture is easily scalable in a cluster environment, making it suitable for large-scale data processing. This enhances both scalability and reproducibility. Containers can run on various cloud platforms and on-premise environments, increasing the compatibility and portability of the analysis pipeline. This flexibility allows users to perform analysis tasks without being tied to a specific infrastructure.

These features significantly contribute to Closha 2.0 evolving into a more efficient and stable analysis platform.
