# CLOSHA.0

Recent advances in various computational algorithms for high-throughput sequencing technologies have accelerated the progress toward a comprehensive understanding of genetic information. However, most of these tools are not user-friendly and interoperable, making it difficult for biologists to design pipelines to meet their needs. We present CLOSHA2.0, a bioinformatics analysis workflow management standard software. Using pipelines provided by CLOSHA2.0, even scientists with a little computer programming experience can easily analyze NGS data. CLOSHA2.0 can also support a computational environment to share analysis workflows and results with other research scientists.
